# Section 4: Edge Detection and Texture Synthesis

This section focuses on two main tasks: implementing various edge detection techniques and exploring texture synthesis algorithms.

## Task 1: Edge Detection

We implement and compare different edge detection techniques on various types of images.

### Implemented Techniques

1. Canny Edge Detection
2. Image Binarization
3. Hole Filling
4. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) Edge Detection

### Images Used

- Grayscale images
- Binary images
- Lenna image (standard test image)

### Comparison: Canny vs. LoG Edge Detection

We demonstrated both Canny edge detection and LoG filter edge detection on the Lenna image in a single plot for comparison.

#### Results

The Canny edge detection algorithm showed more precise results in detecting edges of the Lenna sample image compared to the LoG filter.

#### Analysis

Canny edge detection is often considered superior to the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter for several reasons:

1. **Accuracy**: Canny provides more accurate localization and detection of edges due to its multi-stage process (smoothing, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding). LoG relies solely on convolution with a Gaussian kernel followed by the Laplacian operator, which can lead to false positives and inaccuracies.

2. **Versatility**: Canny handles edges with varying widths and orientations better than LoG, as it uses directional gradient information. This makes it more robust to noise and variation in image intensity.

3. **Control**: Canny allows for more control over threshold values, making it easier to adjust sensitivity and specificity based on application requirements. LoG requires careful tuning of parameters like kernel size and sigma value, which can be time-consuming and complex.

4. **Popularity**: While LoG can be useful in certain applications, Canny remains a popular and widely used method for accurate and reliable edge detection in computer vision.

## Task 2: Texture Synthesis

We implemented and compared different texture synthesis algorithms on various texture samples.

### Implemented Algorithms

1. Random Synthesis
2. Best Random Synthesis
3. Min Cut Synthesis

### Texture Samples Used

- Radishes
- Rocks
- Yogurt
- Berry

### Results and Analysis

Among all the synthesis methods used in this task, the Best Random Synthesis and Min Cut Synthesis algorithms produced the most promising results.

1. **Random Synthesis**: Produced the least convincing results, often creating noticeable artifacts and discontinuities in the synthesized textures.

2. **Best Random Synthesis**: Showed significant improvement over the basic Random Synthesis. It produced more coherent and visually pleasing results for most texture samples.

3. **Min Cut Synthesis**: Also produced good results, often comparable to the Best Random Synthesis. However, its performance varied depending on the specific texture sample.

Overall, the Best Random Synthesis algorithm performed particularly well across the sample images, often producing the most visually convincing results among all the synthesis approaches tested.

This comparison highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate synthesis algorithm based on the specific texture characteristics and desired output quality.
