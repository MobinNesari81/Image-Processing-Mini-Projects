# Section 5: JPEG Image Compression Implementation

This section focuses on implementing the entire procedure for converting an image into the JPEG format. We've created several functions and a JPEG object to handle different stages of the compression process.

## Color Space Conversion

We implemented two functions for color space conversion:

1. `RGB_to_YCrCb`: Converts an image from RGB color space to YCrCb color space.
2. `YCrCb_to_RGB`: Converts an image from YCrCb color space back to RGB color space.

These conversions are crucial for JPEG compression as it operates on the YCrCb color space, which separates luminance (Y) from chrominance (Cr and Cb) components.

## Run-Length Encoding and Decoding

We implemented two functions for run-length encoding and decoding:

1. `run_length_encoding`: Compresses data by replacing sequences of identical data elements with a single data value and count.
2. `run_length_decoding`: Decompresses run-length encoded data back to its original form.

Run-length encoding is used in JPEG compression to efficiently store sequences of zeros in the quantized DCT coefficients.

## JPEG Object Implementation

We created a JPEG object that encapsulates various functions necessary for the JPEG compression process:

### Quantization

1. `encode_quant`: Encodes the image based on a given quantization table.
2. `decode_quant`: De-quantizes the encoded image.

Quantization is a key step in JPEG compression that reduces the precision of the DCT coefficients, allowing for higher compression ratios at the cost of some image quality.

### Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

1. `encode_dct`: Applies the Discrete Cosine Transform to the given image.
2. `decode_dct`: Applies the Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform to the image.

The DCT is used to convert the image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, which allows for more efficient compression.

### Compression

1. `encode_zip`: Compresses the quantized encoding of the image.
2. `decode_zip`: Decompresses the compressed encoding of the image using the zlib library.

These functions handle the final stage of compression and decompression, further reducing the file size of the JPEG image.

## Complete JPEG Compression Process

The complete JPEG compression process implemented in this section follows these steps:

1. Convert the input image from RGB to YCrCb color space.
2. Apply DCT to the image data.
3. Quantize the DCT coefficients.
4. Apply run-length encoding to the quantized coefficients.
5. Apply additional compression (zip) to the encoded data.

To decompress the image, these steps are reversed:

1. Decompress (unzip) the data.
2. Apply run-length decoding.
3. De-quantize the coefficients.
4. Apply Inverse DCT.
5. Convert the image data from YCrCb back to RGB color space.

This implementation provides a comprehensive understanding of the JPEG compression algorithm and allows for experimentation with different quantization tables and compression settings to balance image quality and file size.
